# Sudoku Game

**Welcome!** This project is my Sudoku game, created following the principles of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in C++.

## How to Use:

To get started, simply run the `main.cpp` file. The interface unfolds directly in the console.

At the beginning of the game, users can either load a Sudoku game board from the file or generate a random one based on difficulty levels: easy, medium, or hard (determined by the number of initially empty cells).

The game is designed primarily for user-solving of puzzles, providing multiple options during the solution process - such as filling or clearing a cell (within the rules), viewing the original Sudoku board, and more.

Additionally, there's an algorithmic solution available. At any point, players can opt to let our algorithm solve the puzzle by submitting their matrix.

Games and user's mistakes counters are kept for tracking, and players can enjoy playing (solving) an infinite number of times!

## Technical Details:

- Adheres to OOP principles.
- Implements my personal algorithm for Sudoku game generation.
- Implements the classic backtracking algorithm for solving Sudoku puzzles.
